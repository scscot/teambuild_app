TeamBuild+ Canvas Methodology
Version: 2025-05-17 18:53:15

==========================
‚úÖ VERIFIED CANVAS GENERATION PROTOCOL (V-CGP)
==========================

1. One canvas is created per `.dart` file directly from DartFiles.zip.
2. No templates, inferred logic, or hallucinated content ‚Äî raw file insertion only.
3. Each canvas is line-by-line validated against its source.
4. Canonical integrity (line count, imports, structure) is enforced.
5. Hashes are generated and logged for fidelity verification.

==========================
üõ°Ô∏è CANONICAL SOURCE LOCK ENFORCEMENT (CSLE)
==========================

1. Pre-Patch Canonical Verification:
   - Confirm canvas matches the DartFiles.zip file before any patch.
   - No patching is allowed if the canvas has drifted from source.

2. One-Way Source Authority:
   - DartFiles.zip is the only trusted source at canvas creation time.
   - After first patch, canvas becomes the new trust base.

3. Patch Scope Gate:
   - Only scoped PATCH START/END regions may be used unless full replacement is explicitly authorized.

4. Line Count Parity Check:
   - If line count differs by more than ¬±3 lines from baseline, flag for manual review.

5. Diff Snapshot Transparency:
   - All core canvases must support side-by-side diff audits on request.

üîÑ Post-First Patch Logic:
   - Canvas drift is allowed only after first trusted patch.
   - All future patches are scoped against the current live canvas.

==========================
‚öôÔ∏è OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL (To Reduce Patch Frequency)
==========================

1. Context-Aware Patching:
   - When patching one canvas, anticipate and apply dependent changes in related canvases (e.g. model ‚Üî screen).

2. Dependency Audit System:
   - Maintain a lightweight map of model ‚Üî service ‚Üî screen dependencies to detect patch chains.

3. Integrated Patch Batching:
   - If one patch affects multiple canvases, deliver them together in a sequenced bundle.

4. Session Snapshot & Rewind Support:
   - Before large changes, take a snapshot of the full canvas state to enable rollback.

5. Null Safety & Build Safety Scan:
   - Pre-patch validation for nullability risks and build-breaking edits.

==========================
üîê ENHANCED CANVAS FIDELITY CONTROLS
==========================

1. File-to-Canvas Hash Check:
   - Generate SHA-256 hash of each `.dart` file.
   - Compare before any patch or audit.

2. Canonical Snapshot Log:
   - Log per canvas: filename, line count, creation timestamp, hash.

3. Pre-Patch Structural Snapshot:
   - Save canvas state before patch.
   - Allow automatic reversion if patch fails validation.

4. Visual Diff Auto-Generation (Optional):
   - On command, display source-vs-canvas side-by-side for approval before patching.
